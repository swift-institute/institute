# [API-IMPL-005] one_declaration_per_file was originally part of Phase 1's
# opt_in_rules but was DROPPED after canary testing surfaced an
# architectural mismatch with [TEST-005] @Suite test patterns: SwiftLint
# does not support per-rule path scoping for built-in rules (verified
# 2026-05-05 against rule docs + empirical test), so the rule cannot be
# limited to Sources/ only. The [TEST-005] pattern uses multiple top-level
# fixture types per test file, which one_declaration_per_file flags as
# violations. Deferred to Phase 1.5+ pending either (a) tests refactored
# to nest fixtures, (b) CI restructured for separate Sources/Tests
# invocations, or (c) sub-config fanout infrastructure built.

# SwiftLint 0.63.3's `inclusive_language` rule has NO `allowed_terms` key

# built-in default (`mastercard` — upstream's own false-positive
# exemption for "master" as a payment-network substring, SwiftLint#3415)
# must be re-listed here alongside the RFC 8446 family or it is silently
# dropped fleet-wide. Matching is lowercased range-overlap, so the
# camelCase spec identifiers below work as-is against SwiftLint's

# own wire-visible label strings (e.g. "s hs traffic", "res master";
# https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-7.1) — renaming breaks the
# spec's documented correspondence between identifier and label, and
# spec-fidelity is swift-ietf's reason to exist. The exemption is scoped to
# this exact identifier family, not to "master" as a bare term or to

    # erases it — ceremony, not a fix.
    #   - stdlib `Encodable.encode(to:)`: `func encode(to encoder: Encoder)`

    #   - stdlib `Decodable.init(from:)`: `init(from decoder: Decoder)` /
    #     `init(from decoder: any Decoder)` (same two spellings).
    #   - SwiftSyntaxMacros witnesses (`MemberMacro`, `ExtensionMacro`,
    #     `MemberAttributeMacro`, `AccessorMacro`, and siblings): every
    #     role protocol names its requirement `static func expansion(...)`
    #     and ends the parameter list `in context: some MacroExpansionContext`

    # type, not just the external label — a same-named parameter typed

    #
    # swift-institute/.github#260 (coordinator ruling, comment
    # 5169948783, 2026-08-03) extends the same bounded-lookbehind family
    # to the closure-passthrough rethrow shape: a `throws` function whose
    # ONLY untyped-throws source is rethrowing a generic closure
    # parameter's error alongside the function's own failures. Swift
    # typed throws has no error-union type — `throws(E | F)` is
    # inexpressible — so a function that must independently surface its
    # own typed failures (e.g. `PoolError.timeout`) AND transparently
    # propagate whatever a caller-supplied closure throws cannot express
    # both under one `throws(E)` clause without an API-breaking wrapper
    # error type. The stdlib itself uses untyped throws for exactly this
    # shape (`withThrowingTaskGroup`, `withCheckedThrowingContinuation`).
    # Witness: swift-foundations/swift-resource-pool `ResourcePool.
    # withResource(timeout:_:)` (head 8ca28f8) —
    #   public func withResource<T: Sendable>(
    #     timeout: Duration = .seconds(30),
    #     _ operation: (Resource) async throws -> T
    #   ) async throws -> T
    # Two lookbehinds cover the two `throws` occurrences this shape
    # produces:
    #   1. The closure PARAMETER's own declared `throws` (its function-
    #      type annotation, e.g. `(Resource) async throws -> T`) is
    #      always exempt when it is a labeled parameter's function type —
    #      that `throws` describes what the closure TYPE accepts, not
    #      the enclosing declaration's own error contract, and a caller-
    #      supplied closure's error type is unconstrained by definition.
    #      Anchor: `:` then a bounded `(...)` closure-parameter type then
    #      optional `async`, immediately before `throws`.
    #   2. The ENCLOSING function's own trailing `throws` (e.g. the
    #      `) async throws -> T {` after the full parameter list) is
    #      exempt ONLY when that same closure-parameter shape is the
    #      LAST parameter in the list, i.e. immediately (modulo
    #      whitespace) followed by the parameter list's closing `)` and
    #      the function's own `async throws`. This is the conservative,
    #      mechanically recognizable proxy for "the function's sole
    #      untyped-throws source is the passthrough closure": if another
    #      parameter follows the closure, or the closure is not
    #      immediately adjacent to the outer `)`, the second lookbehind
    #      does not match and the rule still fires (per-site
    #      disable+REASON remains available for shapes this proxy
    #      misses — under-matching is preferred to over-matching).
    # Known limitation (documented, not hidden): this is a structural/
    # textual match, not a data-flow analysis — a function whose last
    # parameter happens to be a stored-not-called throwing closure (never
    # actually invoked to produce the rethrow) matches the same shape and
    # is also exempted. This mirrors the #219 precedent, which is
    # likewise a signature-shape match, not a semantic one; the fleet
    # surface this could over-match is a function accepting a trailing
    # throwing closure it does not call, which is itself an unusual and
    # narrow shape.
    # Ruling conditions: an exempted declaration must document its error
    # contract in its doc comment (which typed failures it throws itself,
    # and that the closure's error is rethrown transparently) — the
    # pattern already on `withResource` at resource-pool head 8ca28f8.
    # Revisit trigger: this exemption is reviewed the day Swift ships an
    # error-union or typed-rethrows capability; it exists because of the
    # expressiveness gap, not despite it.

    #     Error references (conformances `: Error`, generic constraints
    #     `<E: Error>`, associatedtype bounds, function types `(Error)->`)
    #     are all `typeidentifier` and still fire.
    # (b) Associated-type same-type constraint positions (`Error ==` in a
    #     where-clause, e.g. `extension Codec where Error == Never`) — the
    #     added `(?![ \t]*==)` lookahead exempts a bare `Error` immediately
    #     followed by `==` (dot-qualified `Foo.Error ==` was already exempt

    # swift-rfc-2822#136-fix, qualifying with the actual local type
    # `RFC_2822.AddrSpec.Error` rather than `Swift.Error`). The prescribed
    # fix for THIS class is: qualify with the reference's actual local
    # type path (`Outer.Inner.Error`), not `Swift.Error` — qualifying as
    # `Swift.Error` would silently change the type to the protocol
    # existential and break typed-throws call sites and error-producing
    # call sites alike. `Swift.Error` remains correct only when the bare
    # `Error` genuinely denotes the stdlib protocol. End-state (SwiftSyntax
    # symbol resolution) is the only way to distinguish the two cases
    # automatically; until then this stays a manual per-site judgment call.

    message: "Qualify bare 'Error' ([PLAT-ARCH-011]; user-confirmed 2026-05-05). Applies to generic constraints (`<E: Swift.Error>`), conformances (`: Swift.Error`), and any other reference. Avoids ambiguity with namespace-scoped Error types and is the institute's convention everywhere. If the bare 'Error' genuinely denotes the stdlib protocol, qualify as 'Swift.Error'. If it resolves to a local NESTED error type (e.g. a sibling-file `Outer.Inner.Error`), qualify with that type's actual path instead — qualifying those as 'Swift.Error' is semantically wrong and breaks typed-throws/error-producing call sites (see #136). Declaration sites (`struct/enum/class/actor/typealias/associatedtype Error: Swift.Error`) are exempt — that's [API-ERR-002]'s Nest.Name pattern. Backtick-quoted test function names and associated-type `Error ==` constraint positions are also exempt (§NOTES 2026-07-07)."
